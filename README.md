# Light-Detecting Autonomous Rover

An autonomous robotics project demonstrating real-time sensing, decision-making, and actuation using human–computer interaction principles.

## What this project does
- Uses light sensors to perceive environmental input in real time
- Applies rule-based decision logic to determine movement behavior
- Controls motors to respond dynamically to changing light conditions
- Emphasizes clear feedback loops between perception and action

## System overview
Sensor inputs are continuously read by an Arduino microcontroller and mapped to predefined behavioral rules. Based on detected light intensity and direction, the rover adjusts its movement accordingly.

## Tech stack
- Arduino
- Light sensors
- Embedded control logic
